# ðŸ“œ ðŸ“œ Protocol overview

The **Originals-light Protocol** is a highly modular framework designed to facilitate the creation and management of digital assets on the Chromia blockchain. It directly leverages the FT4 standard, ensuring standardized processes for asset registration, minting, and cross-chain operations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Modularity**

The protocol is divided into independent modulesâ€”Assets, Attributes, Interfaces, Collections, and Projectsâ€”each of which can function autonomously or be integrated with others. This modularity allows developers to implement only the components they need, enhancing flexibility and reducing complexity.

### 2. **Asset Handling**

Originals-light uses FT4 assets directly, without additional wrappers, which simplifies operations like asset transferring, balance management, and cross-chain interactions. The direct use of FT4 ensures that all asset operations are consistent with Chromiaâ€™s standards.

### 3. **Dynamic Attributes**

Assets within the protocol can have dynamic attributes, allowing them to evolve over time. These attributes can reference other assets, enabling complex relationships such as hierarchical ownership or linked items in a game (e.g., a hero and their equipment).

### 4. **Interfaces**

Interfaces in the protocol define a set of attributes that an asset must possess. They can be used to categorize assets (e.g., `Hero` in a game) or to apply specific conditions. Interfaces are flexible and can be defined with or without attributes, providing a broad scope for how assets are structured and managed.

### 5. **Extendability**

The protocol is designed to be extendable, with hooks provided before and after key operations like asset registration and minting. This allows developers to customize the behavior of the protocol to fit specific application needs.

### 6. **Collections and Projects**

Assets can be grouped into collections or projects, which serve as organizational tools within the protocol. Collections do not depend on projects, allowing users to decide how to structure their asset management based on their application's requirements.

## Summary

The Originals-light protocol is a robust and adaptable framework that streamlines the management of digital assets on the Chromia blockchain. Its modular design, direct use of FT4 assets, and flexible interface system make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from gaming to industrial use cases.
