| Attribute           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Ownability**      | Originals can be owned by a single address, or have no owner and be â€˜up for grabsâ€™. It is also possible for an address to voluntarily drop or give up ownership.                                                                                                          |
| **Exchangeability** | Originals can be sold to transfer ownership, or â€˜adoptedâ€™ if they have no current owner.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Composability**   | Originals can own and/or wear other Originals. For example, your character in a Role Playing Game can be an NFT, which is able to wear other NFTs as equipment.                                                                                                           |
| **Mutability**      | Originals can evolve over time, for example they can â€˜level upâ€™, get stronger, or even transform to a more powerful form after they acquire enough experience. This feature also allows for items that can degrade, or have a set number of uses before self-destructing. |
| **Programmability** | Originals can be embedded with logic by game developers. This allows them to code both object properties (like weight, durability, bonuses, etc.) and also rules (for example, a character can wear a suit of armor but a suit of armor canâ€™t wear a character).          |
| **Portability**     | Originals can move across chains and thus, from one game to another on the Chromia Blockchain Network where enabled.                                                                                                                                                      |

**Key attributes and way of implementation**

| **Ownability**      | An asset can be owned by a single account or multiple accounts. Originals-light uses the FT4 library as the Chromia standard for assets. Originals-light provides functions for asset registration and minting. Users of Originals-light can decide the strategy for minting in their app. Originals-light provides operations where users of the library can decide to which account assets are minted. Assets can also be registered and minted directly with FT4 operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Exchangeability** | Assets can be transferred, sold (work in progress), or adopted by an account if the asset is only registered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Composability**   | Originals-light provides dynamic attributes. Dynamic attributes allow the creation of attributes that reference other assets. For example, an asset named 'hero' can have an attribute named 'helmet,' which references the 'helmet' asset. Furthermore, the 'helmet' asset can have another attribute named 'jew,' which references the 'jew' asset. This enables the creation of a linking chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Mutability**      | Originals-light attributes support mutability. For example, a 'hero' can have an attribute named 'strength,' which can be updated. Who is authorized to update the attribute can be decided by the app owner. Originals-light allows users to add restrictions to attribute updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Programmability** | Originals-light allows for the addition of properties (like weight, durability, bonuses, etc.) to objects. In the app, these properties are referred to as attributes. Originals-light also supports the use of interfaces, which act as 'types' for assets. For example, if the interface 'hero' requires the attribute 'armor,' then an asset of type 'hero' cannot be created unless the 'armor' attribute is provided with a value. An interface can be declared without attributes as well. In such a case, the interface could, for example, be named 'burnable,' allowing the dapp owner to check if a specific asset can be burned. Linking rules (e.g., a character can wear a suit of armor, but a suit of armor canâ€™t wear a character) can be specified by the user of the Originals-light library. The attribute module is independent of the interface module, meaning attributes can be used without interfaces. In the case of a simple dapp, attributes can be used without interfaces if no specific type for the asset is required. Attributes and interfaces can be added to the entity immediately during registration or later. |
| **Portability**     | Originals-light uses the FT4 standard for cross-chain transfers (implementation ongoing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
